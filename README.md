# Results repository

This repository contains EEG-derived **Independent Component Analysis (ICA) features** related to attention and memory, as well as regional power metrics and statistical summaries.


## Summary of Contents

- `Taiwan_older_GroupN/attention/`  
  Contains ICA-based feature reports for **attention** tasks, stored as PDFs for subjects **101â€“120**.

- `Taiwan_older_GroupN/memory/`  
  Contains ICA-based **P300-related memory** reports in PDF format for the same subjects.

- `subjects_101-120_baseline_multiband_power.csv`  
  Spreadsheet of multiband baseline power for all 20 subjects, organised by frequency band and region.

- `subjects_101-120_baseline_wilcoxon_results.csv`  
  Contains statistical Wilcoxon test results comparing baseline regional powers.

## Purpose

This repository supports the analysis of EEG signals collected from older adult groups in Taiwan, focusing on neurofeedback training for attention and N-back tasks for memory. ICA features and regional power data are provided for in-depth statistical and neurocognitive analysis.
